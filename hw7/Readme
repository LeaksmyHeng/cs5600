Hello,

Thank you for grading my work. Here is the instruction on how to run the code:
- Extract the tar file
- Once you have the file, cd to the directory of the file
- To run the main function, type in make
- To check for memory leak, type in make memory
- To clean up, type in make clean


Assumption in the code:
- User need to put in the unique id
- If the unique id are identical, overwrite the previous file
- The content of the file is a normal text. No new line or anything else presented.
