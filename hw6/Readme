Assignment: Synchronization with Monitors

In this assignment, we are working on BoundedBuffer problem or which  is also known as producer/
consumer problem.

In this assignment
- we have the producer which produces string and place it in the buffer through deposit function
- consumer which consumes the string from the buffer

The main program is in Main.java. In there, I implemented 3 threads for both consumer and producer
but you can test it with more threads if you want by adjusting the variable calls numberOfProducerThreads
and numberOfConsumerThreads. There are 30 number of string per thread with capacity of 50.

I also have the test function to test the string for Generate ThreadID as well.

To run the main program or Main.java, simply download this, decompress that tar file, open this project
and run it in the ide.

To run using makefile:
- go to the project directory then type:
    - make run: to run the java files
    - make clean: to clean all the output files
    - make print: to see whhat comment that is used in make run

Thanks a whole lots for grading my homework!
