Homework: Multiprocess

How to run:
- Type in make (this will compile the cipher and the multiprocess code)
- Type ./multiprocess (this will run the multiprocess code and generate the output_file based on its batch)
	- By default it should be around 97 batch files by default
	- If you want to input the input_file for multiprocess, you could use ./multiprocess "inputfix.txt"
	- If you want to give the prefix to your output_file, you can use ./multiprocess "inputfix.txt" "outputprefix"
		- the output file for this would be "outputprefix_batch%d.txt"
		- without the prefix, the output would be "output_batch%d.txt"

I did the testing in dumper.sh.The test include various aspect like:
- The default where no input and output file is specified
- What happen when it reads the file that is already encoded
- What happen if it reads an empty file
- What happen when there is special character in the file
- What happen when file can't be find
	- By default, this will regenerate the file and this process will turn into the default process after printing file cannot be found


Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for grading!
